Proposed Question to solve: Which household related variables influence the number of people living in a household?
You should conduct an analysis to answer your question using a Generalised Linear Model (GLM). 
Following the analyses, you should then summarise your results in the form of a presentation.

Dataset comes from the FIES (Family Income and Expenditure Survey) recorded in the Philippines. The survey,
which is undertaken every three years, is aimed at providing data on family income and expenditure. Each of the 5
datasets obtained from this survey are from different regions across the Philippines. You will have access to the
following variables, recorded by household (Note: head of the household refers to the person “in charge” of the
house):
• Total.Household.Income – Annual household income (in Philippine peso)
• Region – The region of the Philippines which you have data for
• Total.Food.Expenditure – Annual expenditure by the household on food (in Philippine peso)
• Household.Head.Sex – Head of the households sex
• Household.Head.Age – Head of the households age (in years)
• Type.of.Household – Relationship between the group of people living in the house
• Total.Number.of.Family.members – Number of people living in the house
• House.Floor.Area – Floor area of the house (in 𝑚2)
• House.Age – Age of the building (in years)
• Number.of.bedrooms – Number of bedrooms in the house
• Electricity – Does the house have electricity? (1=Yes, 0=No)
